							Although some attacks are targeted, many are caused by hackers using automated tools, to scan sites on the Internet for known, exploitable vulnerabilities.
							Attacks are happening all the time, and it's our job, as developers to ensure we're writing and deploying secure code.

							So, imagine you're planning a house party. You wouldn't just send out invites without considering potential issues, right?
							You'd think about who might spill drinks on your carpet, who might show up uninvited,
							or who could cause a ruckus and disturb your neighbors. In a way, that's threat modeling!

							Scenario #1: A credential recovery workflow might include “questions and answers,”
							which is prohibited by NIST 800-63b, the OWASP ASVS, and the OWASP Top 10.
							Questions and answers cannot be trusted as evidence of identity as more than
							one person can know the answers, which is why they are prohibited.
							Such code should be removed and replaced with a more secure design.

							Scenario #2: A cinema chain allows group booking discounts and has a
							maximum of fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. Attackers
							could threat model this flow and test if they could book six hundred
							seats and all cinemas at once in a few requests, causing a massive
							loss of income.

							Scenario #3: A retail chain’s e-commerce website does not have protection
							against bots run by scalpers buying high-end video cards to resell auction
							websites. This creates terrible publicity for the video card makers and
							retail chain owners and enduring bad blood with enthusiasts who cannot
							obtain these cards at any price. Careful anti-bot design and domain
							logic rules, such as purchases made within a few seconds of availability,
							might identify inauthentic purchases and rejected such transactions.

					<section>
						<h3>So how does CORS help us secure our site?</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							To clear things up, CORS by itself does not prevent or protect against any cyber attack.
							It does not stop cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  

							The same-origin policy is a concept implemented by web browsers that
							prevent one web page from accessing sensitive data on another page.
							This  type of attack is called a cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF). 

							SOP (same origin policy) Enforcement does NOT prevent a malicious
							site from sending requests  to the REST endpoint with the real credentials
							stored in your browser as  a cookie. It prevents the page from reading the response.

						<h3>Access Control Design Principles</h3>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Design Access Control Thoroughly Up Front</li>
							<li class="fragment">Force All Requests to Go Through Access Control Checks</li>
							<li class="fragment">Deny by Default</li>
							<li class="fragment">Principle of Least Privilege</li>
							<li class="fragment">Don't Hardcode Roles</li>
							<li class="fragment">Log All Access Control Events</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
							<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/v3/en/c7-enforce-access-controls">c7-enforce-access-controls</a>
							Access Control (or Authorization) is the process of granting or denying specific requests from a user,
							program, or process. Access control also involves the act of granting and revoking those privileges.

							It should be noted that authorization (verifying access to specific  features or resources)
							is not equivalent to authentication (verifying  identity).

					<section>
						Components typically run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact.
						Such flaws can be accidental (e.g., coding error) or intentional (e.g., a backdoor in a component).
						<aside class="notes">
							Whatever you're building, it's highly likely you'll be using libraries / frameworks / modules / components that were written by someone else.
							Building on others work is fundamental to the progression of the industry, and there's no point reinventing the wheel.
