A common framework for use of generating threat models is [STRIDE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool-threats#stride-model)

- Spoofing (≠ Authenticity)
- Tampering (≠ Integrity)
- Repudiation (≠ Non-repudiability)
- Info Disclosure (≠ Confidentiality)
- Denial of Service (≠ Availability)
- Elevation of Privilege (≠ Authorization)

Tools like [Threat Dragon](https://www.threatdragon.com/) can be used to create and manage threat models.
