#### Secure Coding Top 10

1. **Input validation**: Verify that all input data is valid and of the  expected type, format, and length before processing it. This can help  prevent attacks such as SQL injection and buffer overflows.
2. **Error handling**: Handle errors and exceptions in a secure manner,  such as by logging them in a secure way and not disclosing sensitive  information to an attacker.
3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement strong authentication  and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can  access sensitive data and resources.
4. **Cryptography**: Use cryptographic functions and protocols to protect  data in transit and at rest, such as HTTPS and encryption - the expected  levels for a given Product Security Level can often be found by  reviewing your Golden Path / Paved Road documentation.
5. **Least privilege**: Use the principle of the least privilege when  writing code, such that the code and the system it runs on are given the  minimum access rights necessary to perform their functions.
6. **Secure memory management**: Use high-level languages recommended in  your Golden Path / Paved Road documentation or properly manage memory to  prevent memory-related vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and  use-after-free.
7. **Avoiding hardcoded secrets**: Hardcoded secrets such as passwords and  encryption keys should be avoided in the code and should be stored in a  secure storage.
8. **Security testing**: Test the software for security vulnerabilities during development and just prior to deployment.
9. **Auditing and reviewing the code**: Regularly audit and review the code  for security vulnerabilities, such as by using automated tools or  having a third party review the code.
10. **Keeping up-to-date**: Keep the code up-to-date with the latest  security best practices and vulnerability fixes to ensure that the  software is as secure as possible.
