Many security issues are caused by an oversight during the planning phases. This is particularly prevalent in agile teams, who are pushed to iterate on new features quickly and without consideration for security.

Secure design is a culture and methodology that constantly evaluates threats and ensures that code is robustly designed and tested to prevent known attack methods. Threat modelling should be included in refinement sessions, especially when a story includes changes to data flow, access control or anything security related.
