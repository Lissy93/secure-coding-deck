In late August 2018 British Airways suffered a data breach whereby 420,000 customers and staff were affected.

This was a Magecart attack, where hackers had injected a malicious JavaScript file, which would capture any data entered on the victim website, and send it back to their C2 portal. This customer data was then sold to another group, who used it to steal funds from the individuals.

This attack had a devastating financial impact, not only on the victims, but also BA who was fined Â£20 million, and saw a sharp drop in their stock price.
