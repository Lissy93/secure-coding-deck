    Least privilege and separation of duties: This principle restricts system access to only what a user needs to perform their job, minimizing potential damage if their credentials are compromised. Separation of duties requires more than one person to perform sensitive tasks, reducing the chance of malicious or erroneous actions.

    Defense-in-depth: This strategy uses multiple layers of security controls placed throughout an IT system. It's based on the military principle that it's more difficult for an enemy to penetrate multiple lines of defense than just one.

    Zero trust: This security model operates on the principle "never trust, always verify." It assumes all traffic, whether inside or outside the network, is a potential threat and therefore must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted.

    Security in the open: Also known as "open security" or "security through transparency," this principle posits that systems and protocols are more secure when their designs are open to public scrutiny, allowing vulnerabilities to be discovered and fixed more effectively.
